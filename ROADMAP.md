# CardinalityEstimation Library - Roadmap for Improvements

## Executive Summary
The CardinalityEstimation library implements a sophisticated cardinality estimator using HyperLogLog with optimizations for small cardinalities (direct counting) and medium cardinalities (linear counting). While the core implementation is solid, there are several opportunities for improvement in terms of performance, usability, extensibility, and modern .NET capabilities.

## Current Strengths
- ? Solid HyperLogLog implementation with bias correction
- ? Efficient sparse/dense representation switching
- ? Direct counting for exact results on small sets (?100 elements)
- ? Binary serialization support
- ? Multi-target framework support (.NET 8, .NET 9)
- ? Comprehensive test coverage
- ? Multiple hash function support (Murmur3, FNV-1a, XxHash128)
- ? **Thread-safe concurrent operations with `ConcurrentCardinalityEstimator`**
- ? **Parallel processing and merge operations for high-performance scenarios**
- ? **Lock-free atomic operations where possible for optimal performance**
